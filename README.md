## Hello, World! 
### I am HackUnit, and just like Luffy, I want to become King of the Pira...I mean Programmers! ###

<!-- Currently I am still learning as much as I can. I dropped out of college a few years back since I thought I knew what I wanted, but really didn't. I've been spinning my wheels since...until recently when it was pointed out that I love computers and have always skirted around coding by learning HTML and CSS at a young age, and even brought an old family computer back to life with Kubuntu back in '06 and remember when KDE 4 came out a few years later.

Up til this point, I had in my head that I needed to be a wiz at math, or that I didn't want to make a hobby I loved into a job.
Basically, I was finding *every* excuse not to get into one of the most fascinating fields of work.  Not the technical support stuff, tho.
I am a people person, but 2 decades in customer service has burned me out from ever wanting to help your everyday person. Been there done that.

I want to solve problems, create things, build solutions. I'm a build a bridge rather than burn it kind of guy. A glass is always half full, and
I am tired of being in jobs that kills that part of me. That kills the creator, the builder, the optimist. I want to work with people on the same
page, not some angry old person who is bitching me out because they don't like the companies policy. Where you put on a mask and take the abuse.
Having discussions, or even disagreements with a fellow programmer or project leads/managers is fine and healthy. That can and will tap into my penchant
for communication. We will in the end come to a solution that benefits us and the project we are working on.  You can't win with customers.  
They are always right, and you are always wrong.  
Not with a fellow collaborator. Even if you are wrong, it is a chance to learn what is right, or visaversa. 
I love camaraderie and coming to a solution.
I absolutely thrive on my own as well...which leads to what I'm currently learning and what I'm interested in...

Currently I am learning the *nitty gritty* of **Git**, and **Bash scripting**.  I am also taking a Udemy course on **JavaScript**, and looking to take a **Python** course after that.

I found a great resource put out by IBM called [CognitiveClass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai/), and I'm slowly but surely working my way through an introduction to **Cloud Computing**,
and an "Essentials" guide on **Blockchain** through that resource.

I'm caught between wanting to be a fullstack developer, or DevOps, or maybe something else.
All of it seems so fascinating. Except technical support. I'd rather code and never have to explain how to reset a password to someone who is incredibly fed up and thinks technology is the worst thing to happen since ever and is making it very clear they feel that way and in actuality they are being stubborn and wasting both our times.... Sorry, the customer service PTSD is kicking in...-->

I've become very interested in Web3 and Blockchain. Also, the Rust language looks incredibly cool. If anything, even if it doesn't go anywhere I love being a jack of all trades. Maybe to a detriment, but I hate not knowing something.

I do hope to find collaborators or people who have been in the biz for a while and maybe personally get some direction.  My goal is to become financially sound with a job in tech. Nothing too crazy. I enjoy living within my means.  I'm also a home body. Maybe it's from Homeschooling, but I have no problem working by myself. I try very hard to be a good self starter.

Hopefully, this will be an ever evolving page, and maybe less of me whining about what kind of job I crave.
I guess the other things to mention would be how to reach me, but I don't have anything secured like that...Maybe through here?

Also, last but not least are the machines I'm running.  Nothing too crazy right now.

My main box is a laptop with a second monitor running MX Linux and XFCE as the DE, and I have a secondary laptop that is connected to my printer that is
currently running Fedora and KDE Plasma as the DE. These both are rescue laptops. I really like bringing devices back from the dead with Linux.
Flavors of Linux I have tried are, Debian, (K)ubuntu, Arch, Manjaro, Fedora, MX Linux (and Mepis when it was called that), Knoppix, and several others
I have forgotten. I started with KDE, and it still is my favorite DE, with XFCE being my lite load one. I have tried Gnome a number of times, but still
keep on coming back to good ol' KDE.

Anyways, enough blabbing. Thank you for visiting and I hope you have an excellent rest of your day/night!
